# BigramLanguageModel
A test task for nFactorial Incubator Summer 2023
Due to the lack of experience in working with reading data from a file, I decided to cheat and created my own array with names, and built bigrams from them


1. To start the project, please, download the "bigram language model" folder.
2. Execute the "bigramLanguageModel.playground" code in XCode Playground.
